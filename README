The Java files in src/ with a process() method are to be opened, 
compiled, and loaded in JAS3 and run with .slcio files loaded.

They also rely heavily on the org.lcsim library, which you must have 
registered with JAS3.

At present, the only useful one is stats.java and it has only been 
tested on single 10GeV electron events.
